            <h2> Instructions </h2>
                One card will be distributed over to every player facedown and another card faceup.
            <br>
                Aces count as 1 or 11, and face cards as 10. The rest of the cards are counted by their values.
            <br>
                The player goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card), "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly), or go "bust" (if it is over 21)
            <br>
                When the dealer's total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card.
            <br> 
                Both can also win with 5 cards in hand without "bust"
            <br>
